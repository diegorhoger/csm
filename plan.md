# Stoic Mentor Implementation Plan

## Project Overview
Stoic Mentor is a voice-based AI companion that provides philosophical guidance in the style of famous Stoic philosophers. The application enables natural, human-like conversations with different mentors through voice input/output.

## Core Components (Completed)
- âœ… React/TypeScript project setup with Vite
- âœ… Component architecture and state management
- âœ… Basic UI/UX implementation
- âœ… Audio recording and playback system
- âœ… WebSocket-based Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
- âœ… OpenAI integration for transcription and responses
- âœ… Initial text-to-speech implementation

## Priority 1: Mentor Voice System Enhancement
- ðŸ”² Implement voice preloading to reduce initial latency
- ðŸ”² Create voice profiles for each mentor with consistent parameters
- ðŸ”² Optimize TTS latency to sub-200ms response time
- ðŸ”² Add audio caching for frequently used phrases
- ðŸ”² Implement progressive loading of audio chunks

## Priority 2: Conversation Intelligence
- ðŸ”² Enhance mentor profiles with deeper philosophical nuance
- ðŸ”² Implement context awareness between conversation sessions
- ðŸ”² Develop interruption handling for more natural conversations
- ðŸ”² Create personalized user models based on past interactions

## Priority 3: Audio Processing Refinements
- ðŸ”² Enhance WebSocket VAD with ML-based detection
- ðŸ”² Add spectral analysis for better noise/speech differentiation
- ðŸ”² Implement frequency band filtering for human voice isolation
- ðŸ”² Create environment classification for adaptive processing

## Priority 4: UI/UX Improvements
- ðŸ”² Create AnimatedAvatar component with emotional states
- ðŸ”² Implement dark/light theme support
- ðŸ”² Add conversation history timeline
- ðŸ”² Develop user onboarding tutorial

## Priority 5: Additional Features
- ðŸ”² Implement localStorage for conversation persistence
- ðŸ”² Add journaling functionality to track insights
- ðŸ”² Create daily Stoic challenges system
- ðŸ”² Develop emotion tracking with sentiment analysis

## Technical Implementation Details

### Voice System Enhancement
1. **Voice Preloading**
   - Implement a cache system for ElevenLabs voices
   - Preload introductory phrases and common responses
   - Develop a background loading queue for anticipated responses

2. **Low-Latency Response Pipeline**
   - Implement streaming TTS with chunked responses
   - Optimize backend processing with parallel operations
   - Create fallback rapid response system for immediate feedback

3. **Voice Consistency System**
   - Define specific ElevenLabs parameters for each mentor
   - Create standardized emotion modulations per philosopher
   - Implement voice style persistence across sessions

### Conversation Flow Optimization
1. **Enhanced Interruption Handling**
   - Develop graceful conversation pausing
   - Implement context retention when interrupted
   - Create natural transition phrases when resuming

2. **Context Preservation**
   - Store conversation history with metadata
   - Implement meaning extraction for key discussion points
   - Develop context weighting for more relevant responses

## Testing Strategy
1. **Speech Detection Testing**
   - Benchmark VAD accuracy across different environments
   - Test with various accents and speech patterns
   - Measure false positive/negative rates

2. **TTS Quality Testing**
   - Evaluate voice naturalness and consistency
   - Measure response latency under different conditions
   - Test emotional appropriateness of responses

## Deployment Timeline
1. **Phase 1: Voice System Enhancement** (2 weeks)
   - Complete voice preloading and caching
   - Implement low-latency response pipeline
   - Optimize mentor voice consistency

2. **Phase 2: Conversation Intelligence** (3 weeks)
   - Enhance mentor philosophical profiles
   - Implement improved context awareness
   - Develop better interruption handling

3. **Phase 3: UI/UX Improvements** (2 weeks)
   - Create visual feedback components
   - Implement theme support
   - Develop conversation history visualization

4. **Phase 4: Mobile Adaptation** (3 weeks)
   - Configure mic permissions for iOS and Android
   - Implement Expo background audio handling
   - Create mobile-specific UI components
   - Test performance on various mobile devices

## Implementation Approach

### Voice System Priority Tasks
1. **Immediate Focus: TTS Latency Reduction**
   - Profile current TTS pipeline to identify bottlenecks
   - Implement chunked audio streaming from TTS service
   - Create audio buffer management for seamless playback
   - Develop parallel processing for TTS and response generation

2. **Voice Profile Enhancement**
   - Select optimal ElevenLabs voice models for each philosopher
   - Create consistent parameter profiles (stability, clarity, etc.)
   - Implement voice character stylization per mentor
   - Test voice recognition among users for distinctiveness

3. **Audio Cache System**
   - Design cache storage structure for audio chunks
   - Implement TTL (time-to-live) for cached audio
   - Create preemptive caching for frequently used phrases
   - Develop audio compression for efficient storage

## Progress Tracking
We'll use GitHub issues and project boards to track implementation progress, with weekly reviews to adjust priorities based on development velocity and user feedback.
